Explanation:

__init__.py: This file makes anfuelpriceenv a Python package and defines what's imported when you import the package.
env.py: Contains the actual environment code.
setup.py: This is the essential file for installing the package. It provides metadata (name, version, dependencies) to pip.
find_packages(): Automatically finds and includes all sub-packages.
install_requires: Lists all the dependencies your package needs.
pip install -e .: Installs the package in editable mode, meaning changes you make to the code will be immediately reflected without reinstalling.
DataDic.pt Ensure the DataDic.pt file is in the anfuelpriceenv directory and is included in setup.py
By following these steps, you can create a distributable package for your AnFuelpriceEnv environment, allowing you to share and reuse it more easily.
